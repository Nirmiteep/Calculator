This is a simple calculator built with JavaScript.
The program asks the user to enter two numbers and an operator, then performs the selected arithmetic operation and displays the result in the browser console. 
The method used is IF Else satements 
I chose JavaScript because itâ€™s easy to use, beginner-friendly, and runs directly in the browser.
It lets me quickly test my code and see results without any special setup.
As a student learning frontend development, JavaScript makes building and understanding interactive programs much simpler.
